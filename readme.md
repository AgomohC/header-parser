# Header Parser

[femto-header-parser](https://femto-header-parser.glitch.me/) is a full stack app that parses the request header of the user and returns their IP address, language and user agent. This project idea was gotten from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice).
